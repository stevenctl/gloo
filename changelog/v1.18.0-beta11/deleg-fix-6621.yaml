      gateway2/delegation: fix extraneous route arising from invalid child rule

      There's a bug where if a child route contains an invalid rule (rule
      not matching the parent matcher), then even though the matcher is
      discarded, the rule with an empty matcher but valid backendRef
      is returned by GetDelegatedRoutes(). The result is that a `/`
      route is programmed for such an invalid route rule. A more
      precise fix is to also prune the rules that do not have a valid
      matcher so that we do not rely on the translator to interpret
      a route without a valid matcher as '/', which could be an alternative
      fix though fragile.

      The essence of this fix is to prune both the `rules` and `matches`
      field on the child route when we process it in the context of the
      parent matcher, so that:
      1. invalid matchers on the child route are discarded
      2. invalid rules (no valid child matchers) are also discarded

      Previously, 2. was missing so a child route with a rule without
      a matcher was configured, which results in a `/` route being exposed
      for the corresponding backendRef.
